# Leaving PR Comments

Apply only to comments already authorized by the user's task or an invoked PR
workflow. This formatting skill does not itself authorize posting a comment.
In Codex prefer a connected GitHub tool when it supports the action; otherwise
use authenticated `gh` with a body file for multiline text. Follow the repository's
comment conventions when they specify a different required format.

Prefix every agent-authored comment left on the user's behalf with this GitHub
note callout:

```md
> [!NOTE]
> 🤖 **<model> responding on behalf of <user>**

Actual comment starts here.
```

Use the verified public name of the model that wrote the comment, and the
user's name or GitHub login.

If the harness does not expose a model name, use the harness name. Do not guess.
A Claude CLI reviewer does not make a Codex-authored reply a Claude comment;
attribute the writer and describe reviewer contributions separately when useful.

Before posting, check the entire comment, including quoted text and
attachments, for secrets and private details.

Keep the attribution inside the note and the actual reply outside it. The
context line must start with the robot emoji. Do not add a horizontal rule,
Setext underline, heading, signature footer, or a second attribution.

Apply this format to top-level PR comments, inline review comments, replies to
bots or reviewers, and written explanations used before resolving or
dismissing feedback. Do not add it to PR descriptions, commit messages, or text
the user explicitly asked to post verbatim without attribution.

Write the comment itself in a direct style:

- Lead with the conclusion.
- Cite the relevant code, behavior, check, or reproduction.
- Keep it concise and avoid filler, canned thanks, or status narration.
- Distinguish verified facts from judgment.

Preview the final Markdown before posting so quoting and blank lines render as
shown. After posting, verify that GitHub returned the comment or review URL.
Resolve a review thread only after its response was posted successfully.

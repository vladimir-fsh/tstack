# Full Stop

Do the same work as `full-send`, but stop with the PR ready for the user to merge.
Never merge it.

Read [full-send](../full-send/SKILL.md) and follow its workflow, proof rules,
review, and babysitting steps. An explicit "full stop" request authorizes that
work without a separate "full send" request, including its testing permission.
Its merge permission does not apply. The overrides below take precedence.
A casual "full stop" used as punctuation is not a workflow request.

## No merging

You may commit, push, rebase, fix conflicts, and use `--force-with-lease` on
this task's branch. Never merge, enable auto-merge, enter a merge queue, push
to the default branch, bypass branch protection, or delegate those actions.

Disable existing auto-merge and remove the PR from any merge queue before
work begins; check again before each push. Report these changes. If you
cannot prevent automatic merging, report the blocker before proceeding.

## Stop at the gate

Use full-send's merge gate as the readiness check. Replace its merge and
final report steps with a handoff. Proof and review must cover the final diff;
recheck behavior changes and meaningful conflict fixes before handoff.

Fetch the target branch and check the live PR's head, base, checks, reviews,
and mergeability. Confirm it is open, not a draft, and not set to merge
without the user. If someone else merged it, report that instead.

- **Ready to merge:** the merge gate passes. Leave the PR open and unmerged.
- **Waiting for required approval:** only human approval remains. Confirm
  that this is the actual blocker.
- **Blocked:** explain what prevents readiness, what you tried, and what is
  needed. Follow full-send's rules for asking the user.

Stop this task's `pr-wait` process before handoff or a question that ends active
work. Report the PR link, final head, verdict, proof, reviewer outcome, and
remaining risks. State whether the PR is still open and unmerged.
